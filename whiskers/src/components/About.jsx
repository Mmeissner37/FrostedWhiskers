          <h3 id="about-welcome"><strong>Welcome fellow cat lovers!</strong></h3>
          <p>
            Located in the Shenandoah Valley, we are the first cat café in the
            Winchester, VA area!
          </p>
          <p>
            We work with local feline rescues, such as SPCA NOVA, Dakota’s Dream
            Animal Rescue and Frederick County Esther Boyd Animal Shelter, to
            house adoptable cats in need of homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll find a delicious menu of coffee and homemade pastries, along
            with a selection of products to enrich your feline friend's life. Each
            purchase provides financial support for our cats. Extra proceeds are
            donated to <a href="#local_rescues">local rescues</a>.
